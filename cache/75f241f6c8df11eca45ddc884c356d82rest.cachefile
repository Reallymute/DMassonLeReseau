- Squiz.Formatting.OperatorBracket no longer errors for negative array indexes used within a function call
- Squiz.PHP.EmbeddedPhp no longer expects a semicolon after statements that are only opening a scope
- Fixed a problem where the content of T_DOC_COMMENT_CLOSE_TAG tokens could sometimes be (boolean) false
- Developers of custom standards with custom test runners can now have their standards ignored by the built-in test runner
  -- Set the value of an environment variable called PHPCS_IGNORE_TESTS with a comma separated list of your standard names
  -- Thanks to Juliette Reinders Folmer for the patch
- The unit test runner now loads the test sniff outside of the standard's ruleset so that exclude rules do not get applied
  -- This may have caused problems when testing custom sniffs inside custom standards
  -- Also makes the unit tests runs a little faster
- The SVN pre-commit hook now works correctly when installed via composer
  -- Thanks to Sergey for the patch
